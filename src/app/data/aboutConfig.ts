        bio: 'Hello and welcome to Expression Neuroscience! I am Anki, a dual citizen between where I currently live in the U.S. and the Netherlands. I hold a bachelors of science in Information Technology with a minor in Computer Science. Currently I am pursuing a post-baccalaureate degree in biology to expand my knowledge of the field I find myself in. I have had a passion for engineering since I was a little kid taking apart the microwave to see how it works. I am diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and autism; life has not been easy living with chronic mental health conditions, and I do not want the next generation to have to suffer like I do.',

My name is Jon, California native born and raised in the Bay Area with a deep passion for political science, library science, and mental health. I currently hold a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Political Science with a concentration in Public Affairs and Administration from CSU East Bay with the intention of pursuing grad school for a Masters in Library Science with the hopes of working administrative and management work in the Library Field. As I have grown up and developed as a person, I realised my key trait is communication and cooperation and I wish to utilize that to help out my local communities. When I was 23 I was diagnosed with Anxiety, Depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and a year after I got my diagnosis for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). My journey has been fraught with personal struggles and pain but I know that I can carry out my life for the benefit of those around me and uplift those who need it most in my community.',

        bio: 'Growing up in a family in STEM I have always been drawn to the world of science, I chose to pursue a degree in biology at CSU Channel Islands and currently futhering in a masters in bioinformatics. Following my brothers diagnosis of schizophrenia, I became more intrested in the field of pharmacology. Specifically, in the novel approaches to treatment of neurological disorders, such as focus on microbiome. I hope to work in research in this area to help minimize the trial and error that is present in treatment stratagies today.',
