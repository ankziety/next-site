    title: 'Our Mission',
    text: `Expression Neuroscience Institute (ENI) is a Gen Z-led nonprofit researching how the brain works. We're particularly interested in mental health conditions like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) - partly because our founders live with these conditions. Our goal is to make neuroscience research more open, accessible, and useful for everyone.`,

        bio: `I hold a Bachelor's of science in Information Technology with a minor in Computer Science. Currently I am pursuing a post-baccalaureate degree in biology to expand my knowledge of the field I find myself in. I have had a passion for engineering since I was a little kid taking apart the microwave to see how it works. I am diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and autism; life has not been easy living with chronic mental health conditions, and I do not want the next generation to have to suffer like I do.`,

        bio: `I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a Minor in Information Technology. I was born in San Francisco, California, and am currently in the process of obtaining my French citizenship by descent. My first hand observation of the significantly imbalanced gender ratio in my chosen major has shown me the importance of encouraging the next generation to explore difficult and unfamiliar fields. I have struggled with mental health issues for most of my life, which unfortunately went undiagnosed until this past year when I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Agoraphobia, and Social Phobia. My personal struggles with mental health, and the struggles of those I care about, have made me very passionate about helping further our generation's understanding of our brains and how they work.`,

        bio: `California native born and raised in the Bay Area with a deep passion for political science, library science, and mental health. I currently hold a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science with a concentration in Public Affairs and Administration from CSU East Bay with the intention of pursuing grad school for a Masters in Library Science with the hopes of working administrative and management work in the Library Field. As I have grown up and developed as a person, I realized my key trait is communication and cooperation and I wish to utilize that to help out my local communities. When I was 23 I was diagnosed with Anxiety, Depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and a year after I got my diagnosis for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). My journey has been fraught with personal struggles and pain but I know that I can carry out my life for the benefit of those around me and uplift those who need it most in my community.`,

        bio: `Growing up in a family in STEM I have always been drawn to the world of science, I chose to pursue a degree in biology at CSU Channel Islands and currently furthering in a masters in bioinformatics. Following my brothers diagnosis of schizophrenia, I became more interested in the field of pharmacology. Specifically, in the novel approaches to treatment of neurological disorders, such as focus on microbiome. I hope to work in research in this area to help minimize the trial and error that is present in treatment strategies today.`,
